# Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 2025

## Overview

This website uses analytics to understand how people use the site. I value your privacy and want to be transparent about what little data is collected.

## What Gets Collected

I use Vercel Analytics to see basic information about site visits:

- Which pages are viewed and when
- General location (country, state, city - derived from IP address)
- Browser and operating system
- Device type (mobile or desktop)
- How you arrived at the site (search engine, direct link, etc.)

## What Doesn't Get Collected

- No personal information (names, emails, etc.)
- No cookies to track you
- No IP addresses are stored
- No tracking across websites
- No user accounts or profiles

## How This Information Is Used

The anonymous analytics help me:
- See which content is most helpful
- Ensure the site works well on different devices
- Understand general visitor patterns

I can't identify individual visitors - all data is aggregated and anonymous.

## Data Handling

Analytics data is processed by Vercel Inc. and visitor sessions expire after 24 hours. All connections are encrypted with HTTPS.

## Your Choices

If you prefer not to be included in analytics, most ad blockers and privacy browser extensions will prevent the analytics from loading.

## Third-Party Services

This site's analytics are provided by Vercel. You can read more about their practices in [Vercel's Privacy Policy](https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy).

## Updates

Any significant changes to this policy will be reflected here with an updated date.

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, feel free to reach out through the contact information on the site.
